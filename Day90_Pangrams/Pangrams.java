/* Question:
A jail has a number of prisoners and a number of treats to pass out to them. 
Their jailer decides the fairest way to divide the treats is to seat the prisoners around a circular table in sequentially numbered chairs. 
A chair number will be drawn from a hat. Beginning with the prisoner in that chair, 
one candy will be handed to each prisoner sequentially around the table until all have been distributed.
The jailer is playing a little joke, though. The last piece of candy looks like all the others, but it tastes awful. 
Determine the chair number occupied by the prisoner who will receive that candy.
