/*Question: 
HackerLand Enterprise is adopting a new viral advertising strategy. When they launch a new product, they advertise it to exactly 5 people on social media.
On the first day, half of those 5 people (i.e.floor = 5/2 = 2) like the advertisement and each shares it with  of their friends. At the beginning of the second day,  people receive the advertisement.
Each day, floor = 5/2 *3 = 2 * 3 = 6 of the recipients like the advertisement and will share it with 3 friends on the following day.
Assuming nobody receives the advertisement twice, determine how many people have liked the ad by the end of a given day, beginning with launch day as day .
Example:
.n = 6
Day Shared Liked Cumulative
1      5     2       2
2      6     3       5
3      9     4       9
4     12     6      15
5     18     9      24
The progression is shown above. The cumulative number of likes on the 5th day is 24th .
