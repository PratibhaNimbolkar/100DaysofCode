Input: A = " "
Output: true


LOGIC: 

We entered an string by user.

Then,

We started a loop till the length of Inputed string .

And we are storing each character of string in S .

And transferring it to a new string variable character wise.


Then we are using IF condition to check whether the string reversed is same as entered to check palindrome.

If condition is true printing yes

Else

Printing No
