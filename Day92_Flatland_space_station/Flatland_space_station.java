/* Question:
Flatland is a country with a number of cities, some of which have space stations. 
Cities are numbered consecutively and each has a road of  length connecting it to the next city.
It is not a circular route, so the first city doesn't connect with the last city. 
Determine the maximum distance from any city to its nearest space station.
